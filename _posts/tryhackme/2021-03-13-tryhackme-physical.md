They provide a step by step walk through of basic lock picking and other security bypassing techniques. After taking as many notes as possible from both videos, its time to jump into the meat of things.

This task asks us to display our new found knowledge of locking, by asking us a little bit about lock picking techniques and locks. There are numerous locks and each type has a different approach for how to pick it. The most common techniques are SSP or Single Pin Picking, which is fairly self explanatory and bump keys. Bump keys are specially made keys used in conjuction with a hammer (or similar) and a rubber band to force the pins into place.
